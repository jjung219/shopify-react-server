# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the app

1. Run this command to clone this server repo

```rb
git clone git@github.com:jjung219/shopify-react-server.git jennifer-shopify
```

2. In the terminal, go into the cloned directory

```rb
cd jennifer-shopify
```

3. Run this command to clone the client repository inside the cloned repo

```rb
git clone git@github.com:jjung219/shopify-react.git client
```

4. Make sure localhost://5000 and localhost://3000 isn't already taken

5. Install all dependencies in the server and in the client folder

```rb
npm install
```

5. Go back to the server folder and run 'npm run dev'. This will concurrently start the server and client.

6. You should see a page that looks like [this](https://github.com/jjung219/shopify-react/blob/master/public/images/Screen%20Shot%202021-09-01%20at%204.08.18%20PM.png)!
