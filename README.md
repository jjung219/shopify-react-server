# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the app

1. Run this command to clone this server repo

```rb
git clone git@github.com:jjung219/shopify-react-server.git jennifer-shopify
```

2. In the terminal, go into the cloned directory

3. Run this command to clone the client repository inside the cloned repo

```rb
git clone git@github.com:jjung219/shopify-react.git client
```

4. Make sure localhost://5000 isn't already taken

5. While you are still inside the server directory, run 'npm run dev'. This will concurrently start the server and client.

6. Start playing around in the app!
